# Data Science Capstone
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This repository contains the final project for the Data Science Capstone course. The project focuses on multiple aspects of data science, including data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and interactive visual analytics. The key tasks and techniques applied in this repository are:

## Contents:

1. **Data Collection with Web Scraping**:
   - Web scraping techniques to collect data from various sources.

2. **Data Collection using API**:
   - Utilizing APIs to gather datasets for analysis and processing.

3. **EDA with SQL**:
   - Performing exploratory data analysis using SQL queries on the provided datasets.

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium**:
   - Creating interactive maps and visualizations using Folium for geospatial data insights.

5. **Machine Learning Prediction**:
   - Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict outcomes based on the collected data.

6. **SpaceX Dash App**:
   - A SpaceX launch dashboard application that visualizes data about SpaceX launches and provides insights into the performance of different launches.

## Repository Files:

- **Data Collection with Web Scraping.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for web scraping data.
